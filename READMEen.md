### üåü Project Objective  

The main goal of **So Long** is to create a **small 2D game** where the player can move through a maze, collect objects, and reach an exit to win. The project uses the **MinilibX** (MLX) graphics library to handle rendering and interactions.

### üïπÔ∏è Features  

Here are the key features that the project must implement:  

1. **Map Reading:**  
   - The game uses a `.ber` file to define the maze.  
   - The map must be properly formatted (rectangular, enclosed by walls, etc.).  

2. **Player Movement:**  
   - The player can move in four directions (up, down, left, right).  
   - Movements are counted and displayed.  

3. **Object Collection:**  
   - The player must collect all objects (usually represented by "C" on the map) before reaching the exit.  

4. **Exit Handling:**  
   - The exit (usually represented by "E") is only accessible after collecting all objects.  

5. **Graphical Display:**  
   - Game elements (player, walls, floor, objects, exit) are represented using textures or simple colors.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  

- **Language:** C  
- **Graphics Library:** [MinilibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux)  
- **Compilation:** Makefile  
- **Code Standard:** Strict compliance with 42‚Äôs coding norms.
